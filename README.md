Focus gems are free for any level (other than occupying a slot). Note that focus gems can only be imbued into staves.

You can overcharge an item up to 5 beyond its capacity. The percentage given is the chance of success. If you fail, there is a chance of the crafter and/or item being destroyed. If the chance given is "BOOM!", overcharging at those parameters isn't recommended. Factors that control the chance of overcharge success: item quality, quality of gems used for imbue, amount overcharged, and the skill of the crafter.
